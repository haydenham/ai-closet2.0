# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for transforming the existing local fashion AI prototype into a production-ready platform. The system will provide personalized fashion recommendations by matching AI-generated outfit suggestions to users' uploaded closet items, with user authentication, style profiling, and cloud-based AI model integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Account Management

**User Story:** As a fashion enthusiast, I want to create and manage my account, so that I can securely access my personal closet and style preferences across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user visits the platform THEN the system SHALL require account creation before accessing any features
2. WHEN a user creates an account THEN the system SHALL validate email format and password strength requirements
3. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate credentials and maintain secure session state
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session and redirect to login page
5. IF a user forgets their password THEN the system SHALL provide a secure password reset mechanism

### Requirement 2: Visual Style Profiling and Outfit-Building Quiz System

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to complete a visual style assessment by building outfits from clothing options, so that the system can assign appropriate gender and style tags for personalized fashion recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes account creation THEN the system SHALL present a mandatory 8-question visual style quiz
2. WHEN a user starts the quiz THEN the system SHALL first ask for gender selection to determine the appropriate clothing options
3. WHEN a user progresses through quiz questions THEN the system SHALL present visual clothing items for selection (tops, bottoms, shoes, accessories, complete outfits)
4. WHEN the quiz is completed THEN the system SHALL analyze the selected clothing items to determine and assign appropriate style tags
5. WHEN a user profile is created THEN the system SHALL store the style profile with gender and style tags in the database
6. IF a user wants to retake the quiz THEN the system SHALL allow profile updates and tag reassignment

### Requirement 3: Closet Management and Item Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload and manage my clothing items, so that I can build a digital closet that persists across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads clothing images THEN the system SHALL store images securely in cloud storage with proper metadata
2. WHEN clothing items are uploaded THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings for each item and store them in the database
3. WHEN a user views their closet THEN the system SHALL display all uploaded items with thumbnails and metadata
4. WHEN a user deletes an item THEN the system SHALL remove the item from storage and database permanently
5. WHEN a user reopens the application THEN the system SHALL restore their complete closet from the database
6. IF a user uploads duplicate items THEN the system SHALL detect and handle duplicates appropriately

### Requirement 4: AI Model Integration and Tag-Based Personalization

**User Story:** As a user with a specific style profile, I want the system to use personalized tags that match my preferences, so that I receive tailored fashion recommendations from the AI model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs to generate recommendations THEN it SHALL call the Google Gemini API with user-specific gender and style tags
2. WHEN calling the AI model THEN the system SHALL handle authentication and rate limiting for Google Cloud services
3. WHEN the AI model responds THEN the system SHALL parse the outfit description and extract individual clothing items
4. IF the AI endpoint is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and fallback options
5. WHEN generating prompts THEN the system SHALL incorporate the user's assigned tags to personalize the AI model's responses

### Requirement 5: Outfit Generation and Recommendation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to request outfit suggestions through natural language prompts, so that I can get personalized recommendations for specific occasions or preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a fashion prompt THEN the system SHALL send the request to their assigned AI model
2. WHEN the AI model generates an outfit description THEN the system SHALL parse the response into individual clothing categories
3. WHEN outfit items are identified THEN the system SHALL match each item to the most similar items in the user's closet using embeddings
4. WHEN matches are found THEN the system SHALL display the recommended outfit with actual user clothing images
5. IF no suitable matches exist THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest alternative items or shopping recommendations

### Requirement 6: Database Architecture and Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a robust database structure, so that user data, clothing items, and preferences are reliably stored and retrievable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL connect to a production database with proper connection pooling
2. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL use proper data normalization and indexing for performance
3. WHEN clothing embeddings are stored THEN the system SHALL optimize for similarity search operations
4. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle transactions properly with rollback capabilities
5. IF database connectivity fails THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 7: Security and Data Protection

**User Story:** As a user, I want my personal data and clothing images to be secure, so that my privacy is protected and my account cannot be compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL use secure hashing algorithms with salt
2. WHEN user sessions are managed THEN the system SHALL implement secure session tokens with appropriate expiration
3. WHEN images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file types and scan for malicious content
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption for all communications
5. WHEN user data is accessed THEN the system SHALL implement proper authorization checks
6. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log security events and implement rate limiting

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to respond quickly and handle multiple users, so that I have a smooth experience regardless of system load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users upload images THEN the system SHALL process and store them within 10 seconds
2. WHEN outfit recommendations are requested THEN the system SHALL return results within 15 seconds
3. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN it SHALL handle concurrent requests without performance degradation
4. WHEN embedding searches are performed THEN the system SHALL use optimized vector similarity algorithms
5. IF system load increases THEN the architecture SHALL support horizontal scaling of components

### Requirement 9: Comprehensive Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer and system administrator, I want comprehensive test coverage throughout the development process, so that the system is reliable, maintainable, and functions correctly in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component is developed THEN it SHALL include unit tests with minimum 80% code coverage
2. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN they SHALL have integration tests covering all success and error scenarios
3. WHEN user workflows are implemented THEN they SHALL have end-to-end tests covering complete user journeys
4. WHEN database operations are coded THEN they SHALL include tests for data integrity and transaction handling
5. WHEN AI model integrations are built THEN they SHALL have tests with mocked responses and error conditions
6. WHEN security features are implemented THEN they SHALL include penetration testing and vulnerability assessments
7. WHEN performance requirements are coded THEN they SHALL include load testing and performance benchmarks
