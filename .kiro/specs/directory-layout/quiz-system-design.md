# Visual Style Quiz System Design

## Overview

A scalable, data-driven visual quiz system that determines user style categories through clothing item selection and feature matching algorithms.

## Quiz Flow

### 1. Gender Selection
- **Question 1**: User selects Male or Female
- **Result**: Determines which clothing database to use for subsequent questions

### 2. Clothing Item Selection (Questions 2-6)
- **Question 2**: Pick a top
- **Question 3**: Pick a bottom  
- **Question 4**: Pick shoes
- **Question 5**: Pick layering piece
- **Question 6**: Pick an accessory

### 3. Complete Outfit Selection
- **Question 7**: Pick a complete outfit from curated options

## Data Structure

### Clothing Items (Key-Value System)
Each clothing item is structured as:
```json
{
  "item_id": "mens_white_tshirt_001",
  "name": "Classic White T-Shirt",
  "image_url": "/images/quiz/mens/tops/white_tshirt_001.jpg",
  "gender": "male",
  "category": "top",
  "features": [
    "t-shirt",
    "cotton",
    "white",
    "neutral",
    "casual",
    "basic",
    "fitted",
    "minimalist"
  ]
}
```

## Matching Algorithm

### Feature Scoring System
```python
def calculate_style_scores(selected_items, style_categories):
    scores = {}
    
    for category_name, category_features in style_categories.items():
        score = 0
        total_features = 0
        
        for item in selected_items:
            for feature in item['features']:
                total_features += 1
                if feature in category_features:
                    score += 1
        
        # Calculate percentage match
        scores[category_name] = (score / total_features) * 100 if total_features > 0 else 0
    
    return scores
```

### Weighted Scoring (Advanced)
- **Complete Outfit**: 40% weight (most indicative)
- **Top + Bottom**: 30% weight (core outfit)
- **Shoes**: 15% weight
- **Layering**: 10% weight
- **Accessories**: 5% weight

    def extract_features(self, image_url):
        """Extract visual features from clothing images"""
        features = {
            'colors': self.extract_dominant_colors(image_url),
            'patterns': self.detect_patterns(image_url),  # stripes, polka dots, etc.
            'textures': self.analyze_texture(image_url),  # smooth, rough, knit, etc.

            'style_elements': self.detect_style_elements(image_url)  # buttons, zippers, etc.
        }
        return features
```

### 2. User Satisfaction Tracking
```python
def track_satisfaction_correlation(user_id, quiz_response, satisfaction_rating):
    """Track which feature combinations lead to user satisfaction"""
    selected_features = extract_all_features(quiz_response.selected_items)
    
    # Update feature satisfaction scores
    for feature in selected_features:
        update_feature_satisfaction(feature, satisfaction_rating)
    
    # Track feature combinations that work well together
    for combo in get_feature_combinations(selected_features):
        update_combination_satisfaction(combo, satisfaction_rating)
```

### 3. Automatic Feature Discovery
```python
def discover_new_features():
    """Use clustering to find new feature patterns"""
    # Get all user selections and their satisfaction scores
    high_satisfaction_selections = get_selections_with_high_satisfaction()
    
    # Cluster similar selections to find common patterns
    clusters = cluster_selections(high_satisfaction_selections)
    
    # Analyze clusters to suggest new features
    for cluster in clusters:
        common_elements = find_common_visual_elements(cluster)
        suggested_features = generate_feature_suggestions(common_elements)
        
        # Queue for admin review
        queue_for_feature_review(suggested_features)
```

### 4. Feature Validation Pipeline
```python
class FeatureValidationPipeline:
    def validate_suggested_feature(self, feature_name, item_id):
        """Multi-stage validation for new features"""
        
        # Stage 1: Computer Vision Confidence
        cv_confidence = self.cv_validator.validate_feature(feature_name, item_id)
        
        # Stage 2: User Validation (A/B test)
        user_validation = self.run_user_validation_test(feature_name, item_id)
        
        # Stage 3: Expert Review
        expert_review = self.queue_for_expert_review(feature_name, item_id)
        
        # Combine scores for final decision
        final_score = self.combine_validation_scores(
            cv_confidence, user_validation, expert_review
        )
        
        return final_score > VALIDATION_THRESHOLD
```

### 5. Feature Correlation Mining
```python
def mine_feature_correlations():
    """Find features that commonly appear together"""
    all_items = get_all_clothing_items()
    
    for item_a in all_items:
        for item_b in all_items:
            if item_a.id != item_b.id:
                common_features = set(item_a.features) & set(item_b.features)
                
                # Update correlation matrix
                for feature_combo in combinations(common_features, 2):
                    update_correlation_strength(feature_combo[0], feature_combo[1])
    
    # Suggest new feature combinations based on strong correlations
    suggest_feature_combinations()
```

### 6. Behavioral Feature Mining
```python
def analyze_post_quiz_behavior(user_id, assigned_style):
    """Analyze user behavior after quiz to validate style assignment"""
    
    # Track what users actually upload to their closet
    uploaded_items = get_user_uploaded_items(user_id, days=30)
    
    # Extract features from uploaded items
    uploaded_features = extract_features_from_uploads(uploaded_items)
    
    # Compare with assigned style features
    style_features = get_style_category_features(assigned_style)
    
    # Calculate alignment score
    alignment = calculate_feature_alignment(uploaded_features, style_features)
    
    if alignment < ALIGNMENT_THRESHOLD:
        # User's actual style differs from quiz result
        suggest_style_reassignment(user_id, uploaded_features)
        
        # Learn from this mismatch
        update_quiz_algorithm_weights(quiz_features, uploaded_features, alignment)
```

### 7. Continuous Learning Loop
```python
class ContinuousLearningSystem:
    def daily_learning_cycle(self):
        """Run daily to improve the system"""
        
        # 1. Process new user feedback
        self.process_user_feedback()
        
        # 2. Run CV feature extraction on new items
        self.extract_features_from_new_items()
        
        # 3. Update feature correlations
        self.update_feature_correlations()
        
        # 4. Discover new feature patterns
        self.discover_new_features()
        
        # 5. Validate pending features
        self.validate_pending_features()
        
        # 6. Update algorithm weights
        self.update_algorithm_weights()
        
        # 7. Generate insights report
        self.generate_insights_report()
```

### Data Quality Metrics
- **Feature Accuracy**: % of auto-extracted features validated by users
- **Satisfaction Correlation**: How well feature combinations predict user satisfaction
- **Discovery Rate**: Number of new valid features discovered per week
- **Validation Efficiency**: Time from feature suggestion to validation
- **Algorithm Improvement**: Improvement in style assignment accuracy over time

This system creates a self-improving, data-rich environment where the more users interact with the quiz, the better and more detailed it becomes!
