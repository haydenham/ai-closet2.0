# Fashion AI Platform - Scalability Strategy

## 🎯 Scalability Principles

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Stateless Services**: All application services are stateless for easy horizontal scaling
- **Database Read Replicas**: Separate read/write operations for better performance
- **Microservices Architecture**: Independent scaling of different components
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Pub/Sub for decoupled, scalable communication

### Vertical Scaling
- **Auto-scaling Policies**: CPU and memory-based scaling triggers
- **Resource Optimization**: Right-sizing instances based on actual usage
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for scaling decisions

## 🏗️ Scalable Architecture Components

### 1. API Layer Scaling
```
Cloud Load Balancer
    ↓
Cloud Run (Auto-scaling: 0-1000 instances)
    ↓
Cloud SQL (Read Replicas + Connection Pooling)
```

**Scaling Triggers:**
- CPU utilization > 70%
- Memory utilization > 80%
- Request latency > 2 seconds
- Concurrent requests > 80% of instance capacity

### 2. Database Scaling Strategy
```
Primary Database (Cloud SQL)
    ↓
Read Replicas (2-5 instances based on load)
    ↓
Connection Pooling (PgBouncer)
    ↓
Query Optimization & Indexing
```

**Scaling Metrics:**
- Connection count
- Query response time
- CPU/Memory utilization
- Disk I/O patterns

### 3. Storage Scaling
```
Cloud Storage (Multi-regional)
    ↓
Cloud CDN (Global edge caching)
    ↓
Image Optimization Pipeline
```

**Auto-scaling Features:**
- Automatic multi-regional replication
- CDN cache warming
- Intelligent tiering based on access patterns

### 4. Caching Strategy
```
Application Layer
    ↓
Redis Cluster (Memorystore)
    ↓
CDN Edge Caching
    ↓
Browser Caching
```

**Cache Layers:**
- L1: Application memory cache (short-term)
- L2: Redis cluster (medium-term)
- L3: CDN edge cache (long-term)
- L4: Browser cache (client-side)

## 📊 Performance Targets

### Response Time Targets
- API endpoints: < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Image uploads: < 2 seconds
- Quiz completion: < 500ms
- Database queries: < 50ms (95th percentile)

### Throughput Targets
- Concurrent users: 10,000+
- API requests/second: 1,000+
- Image uploads/minute: 500+

### Availability Targets
- Uptime: 99.9% (8.76 hours downtime/year)
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): < 15 minutes
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): < 5 minutes

## 🔄 Auto-scaling Configuration

### Cloud Run Scaling
```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    run.googleapis.com/execution-environment: gen2
    autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale: "1"
    autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale: "1000"
    run.googleapis.com/cpu-throttling: "false"
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale: "1000"
        run.googleapis.com/execution-environment: gen2
    spec:
      containerConcurrency: 80
      timeoutSeconds: 300
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/fashion-ai-backend
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "2"
            memory: "4Gi"
          requests:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: "2Gi"
```

### Database Scaling
```sql
-- Read replica configuration
CREATE REPLICA fashion_ai_read_replica_1 
FROM fashion_ai_primary
WITH (
  REGION = 'us-east1',
  TIER = 'db-standard-2'
);

-- Connection pooling
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 200;
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements';
```

## 📈 Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Application Metrics**
   - Request rate and latency
   - Error rate and types
   - Memory and CPU usage
   - Active connections

2. **Database Metrics**
   - Query performance
   - Connection pool usage
   - Replication lag
   - Lock contention

3. **Infrastructure Metrics**
   - Instance health
   - Network throughput
   - Storage utilization
   - Cache hit rates

### Alerting Thresholds
```yaml
alerts:
  high_latency:
    condition: "response_time_95th > 2s"
    severity: "warning"
    
  high_error_rate:
    condition: "error_rate > 5%"
    severity: "critical"
    
  database_connections:
    condition: "connection_usage > 80%"
    severity: "warning"
    
  memory_usage:
    condition: "memory_usage > 85%"
    severity: "critical"
```

## 🧪 Load Testing Strategy

### Testing Scenarios
1. **Baseline Load**: Normal traffic patterns
2. **Peak Load**: 3x normal traffic
3. **Stress Test**: 10x normal traffic until failure
4. **Spike Test**: Sudden traffic increases
5. **Endurance Test**: Sustained load over time

### Testing Tools
- **Artillery.js**: API load testing
- **k6**: Performance testing
- **Google Cloud Load Testing**: Infrastructure testing
- **Custom scripts**: Business logic testing

## 🔧 Optimization Techniques

### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Indexing strategy
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_quiz_responses_user_id 
ON quiz_responses(user_id);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_clothing_items_features_gin 
ON quiz_clothing_items USING GIN(features);

-- Query optimization
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT * FROM quiz_clothing_items 
WHERE gender = 'male' AND features @> '["casual"]';
```

### Caching Strategy
```python
# Multi-level caching implementation
@cache_with_ttl(ttl=300)  # 5 minutes
def get_quiz_items_by_category(gender: str, category: str):
    # Database query with caching
    pass

@cache_with_ttl(ttl=3600)  # 1 hour
def get_style_categories(gender: str):
    # Long-term caching for relatively static data
    pass
```

### Image Optimization
```python
# Automatic image optimization pipeline
def optimize_image_for_web(image_data: bytes) -> bytes:
    # Resize, compress, and convert to WebP
    # Generate multiple sizes for responsive design
    # Implement lazy loading support
    pass
```

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Blue-Green Deployment
1. Deploy new version to "green" environment
2. Run health checks and smoke tests
3. Gradually shift traffic from "blue" to "green"
4. Monitor metrics and rollback if needed

### Canary Deployment
1. Deploy to small percentage of traffic (5%)
2. Monitor key metrics for 30 minutes
3. Gradually increase traffic (25%, 50%, 100%)
4. Automatic rollback on error threshold breach
