  - Memory: 2GB, CPU: 1 vCPU, Min instances: 0, Max: 3
- [ ] Set up Gemini Pro Vision API access
  - Configure API credentials
  - Set rate limits and quotas

#### **Day 2-3: Core Implementation**
```python
# New service architecture
class HybridClothingAnalyzer:
    """
    Combines Fashion-CLIP (fashion-specific) with Gemini Vision (general intelligence)
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.fashion_clip = FashionCLIPService()  # Specialized fashion understanding
        self.gemini = GeminiVisionService()       # General vision + validation
        self.cache = RedisCache()                 # Cost optimization
    
    def analyze(self, image_data: bytes) -> Dict:
        # Check cache first (cost savings)
        cache_key = hashlib.md5(image_data).hexdigest()
        if cached := self.cache.get(cache_key):
            return cached
            
        # Parallel processing for speed
        clip_task = asyncio.create_task(self.fashion_clip.analyze(image_data))
        gemini_task = asyncio.create_task(self.gemini.analyze(image_data))
        
        clip_results, gemini_results = await asyncio.gather(clip_task, gemini_task)
        
        # Intelligent fusion
        final_results = self.merge_results(clip_results, gemini_results)
        self.cache.set(cache_key, final_results, ttl=3600)
        
        return final_results
```

### **Days 4-5: Replace Existing System**
- [ ] Archive current `gcp_vision_service.py` (rename to `_deprecated_gcp_vision_service.py`)

    """
    base_scores = {
        'semantic_features': self._calculate_semantic_similarity(item, ai_request),
        'style_consistency': self._calculate_style_consistency(item, ai_request),
        'category_appropriateness': self._calculate_category_appropriateness(item, ai_request),
        'color_harmony': self._calculate_color_harmony(item, ai_request)
    }
    
    # Apply user preference weighting
    personalization_boost = self._calculate_user_preference_boost(item, user_profile)
    
    final_score = (
        base_scores['semantic_features'] * 0.35 +
        base_scores['style_consistency'] * 0.25 +
        base_scores['category_appropriateness'] * 0.20 +
        base_scores['color_harmony'] * 0.20
    ) * (1 + personalization_boost)  # Boost based on user preferences
